# Write the two action functions, hold and roll. Each should take a
# state as input, apply the appropriate action, and return a new
# state.

# States are represented as a tuple of (p, me, you, pending) where
# p:       an int, 0 or 1, indicating which player's turn it is.
# me:      an int, the player-to-move's current score
# you:     an int, the other player's current score.
# pending: an int, the number of points accumulated on current turn, not yet scored
